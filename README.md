# lizard-wizard

This is a little game about a lizard.
The lizard lives at Uxmal, about 45 minutes from Mérida, the capital of Yucatán state in Mexico.

It's JavaScript using Phaser 3's modular framework to render to the HTML5 canvas.

If the whole thing seems like a cheap excuse for me to get pedantic about maze algorithms, you're not wrong.
But I also had a really good time making the lizard animation.
